## What is made for?

It is made to help keep all constants on hand when they are needed. This app contains a bunch of physics (primary), chemistry and math constants, which you can use straight in your calculations.
This app is supposed to be used with HP Prime calculator.

## But I know all the constants!

Great! And it's also easy to have much risk of being mistaken, not to mention the loss of time in vain for data entry. So this app is exactly for that â€“ it decreases the risk of being mistaken which sometimes can cause _reeeally big_ problems and saves your time!

## How to install?
Firstly, you need to get [HP Connectivity Kit](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Prime-Graphing-Calculator/5367459/model/5367460). In the _Calculators_ window find your calculator and open _Programs_ folder. After that just drag and drop the _Constants.hpprgm_ there and click _Save_ button in the menu.

## How to use it?

Click on _Toolbox_ menu button on the keyboard (the black one) and find _User_ button

Choose _Constants_
